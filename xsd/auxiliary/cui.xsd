Per 502(g): (1) "attorney-client privilege" means the protection that applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client communications; and (2) "work-product protection" means the protection that applicable law provides for tangible material (or its intangible equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.  Note: There are three limited dissemination control markings that can be used with this category; Attorney Work Product (AWP), Attorney Client Privilege (AC), and Deliberative Process Privilege (DELIB). These limited dissemination control markings may be used to help identify the type of privilege in the document and limit the dissemination of that information so as to preserve that privilege. These limited dissemination control markings (AWP, AC, DELIB) may only be used on information protected under the CUI "Legal Privilege" category.</xs:documentation>
