Per 502(g): (1) "attorney-client privilege" means the protection that applicable law provides for confidential attorney-client communications; and (2) "work-product protection" means the protection that applicable law provides for tangible material (or its intangible equivalent) prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.  Note: There are three limited dissemination control markings that can be used with this category; Attorney Work Product (AWP), Attorney Client Privilege (AC), and Deliberative Process Privilege (DELIB). These limited dissemination control markings may be used to help identify the type of privilege in the document and limit the dissemination of that information so as to preserve that privilege. These limited dissemination control markings (AWP, AC, DELIB) may only be used on information protected under the CUI "Legal Privilege" category.</xs:documentation>

          <xs:documentation>Releasable by information disclosure official. A permissive foreign disclosure and release marking used on information to indicate that the originator has authorized a Senior Foreign Disclosure and Release Authority (SFDRA) to make further sharing decisions for uncaveated intelligence material (intelligence with no restrictive dissemination controls) in accordance with existing procedures, guidelines, and implementation guidance. Second party integrees (people who work solely under direction and operational control of the Director of the NSA/Chief of Central Security Service on cryptologic or information assurance activities) may access RELIDO information that is not classified military information (CMI) or signals intelligence (SIGINT) without a SFDRA review, including intelligence information created after 28 June 2010 - excluding SIGINT – which carries no foreign disclosure and release markings and hence is treated as if marked RELIDO. Note: Only agencies that are eligible to use RELIDO in the intelligence community (IC) classified information context may use this LDCM on CUI. It is defined and applied in the same manner as in the IC context.</xs:documentation>

          <xs:documentation>Federal Taxpayer Information. Related to returns and return information which are submitted, gathered or generated in conjunction with taxpayers’ responsibilities to comply with federal tax provisions in the United States Code.  “Returns” includes information that is provided to the government pursuant to Title 26, including tax or information returns, declarations of estimated tax or claims for refund. “Return information” includes a taxpayer’s identity, the nature, source or amount of income or any information received by, recorded by, prepared by or furnished to Internal Revenue Service relevant to the determination of tax liability including whether the taxpayer is the subject of investigation. This protection extends to such items as medical, financial and other personal information submitted to the IRS by taxpayers. Standards (typically tolerances, audit criteria and law enforcement techniques) related to the selection of returns for examination should only be disclosed to the extent their disclosure would not impair assessment, collection or enforcement under the internal revenue laws. Tax data originating with the IRS generally retains its confidential status even when it resides with agencies other than the IRS.</xs:documentation>
