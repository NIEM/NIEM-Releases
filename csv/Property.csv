The kinds of data compression are as follows: - None: the data are not compressed. The number of values in the Channel Data element is equal to the number of channels of data represented by the element. - Counted Zeroes: the data have been compressed by the removal of repeated zero values. When a ""0"" value appears in the Channel Data contents, the next value is the number of consecutive zero-value channels beginning with the first zero-value in the sequence. For example, the following 18 channels of uncompressed data: 22 5 0 2 1 0 0 3 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 would be represented in compressed form by 22 5 0 1 2 1 0 2 3 4 0 8 1 The italicized values in the list show cases where one, two, and eight zeroes have been compressed.","cbrncl","CompressionCodeSimpleType","cbrncl:CompressionCodeSimpleType",,,
